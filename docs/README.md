# Cafe​&#769;-Board

Café-Board is an online booking website for a boardgame café based in Dublin. This website displays information to the user such as opening times, location, menu and what games are available.

Bookings can be edited or deteleted depending on their booking status. The user also has the ability to edit their username and email as well as delete their account. The user can also contact the admin of the site by using the contact us section in the footer.

# Agile

## Introduction

Agile planning methodology was used to create the site Caf√©-Board. GitHub projects was used to organise the development process into sprints, epics, Kanban boards and issues.  This was the first time I have undertaken a project that was driven by the agile development process and a learning curve was associated with the development of this project, however the benefits of an agile approach soon outweighed the learning curve associated. I first started by creating issues. These where user stories that had a detailed acceptance criteria and unit tasks associated with each issue. These issues where also labelled using the MoSCoW technique. Each issue was then sorted into the epic in which it belonged. I also compartmentalised each epic into stints for the development process. One stint contained many epics and within this many issues. This project was completed over Four stints of work.

# Agile

## Introduction

Agile planning methodology was used to create the site Caf√©-Board. GitHub projects was used to organise the development process into sprints, epics, Kanban boards and issues.  This was the first time I have undertaken a project that was driven by the agile development process and a learning curve was associated with the development of this project, however the benefits of an agile approach soon outweighed the learning curve associated. I first started by creating issues. These where user stories that had a detailed acceptance criteria and unit tasks associated with each issue. These issues where also labelled using the MoSCoW technique. Each issue was then sorted into the epic in which it belonged. I also compartmentalised each epic into stints for the development process. One stint contained many epics and within this many issues. This project was completed over Four stints of work.

## Benefits of agile development

As mentioned in the introduction there was a learning curve associated with using agile development for the first time, however there was a received number of benefits associated as well. These benefits include:

1. Having a plan in place. It was easier to know which task I was working on and found myself getting less distracted as I was carrying out the work associated with the project.
2. Having a dedicated timeframe for issues to be done. This helped me stay on track in terms of timeframe for the project.
3. Initial overall planning of the project. As a lot of thought went into the user stories I was able to have a better picture of the overall project before starting the work. This sped up production and definitely felt more organised.
4. Easily see the benefits of collaboration. As I was working on this project on my own it was easy to see how the use of agile would benefit collaboration if multiple people where working on a project together. Especially with the Kanban board, being able to see what is being worked on and the status of the work and also being able to assign this work to individual developers.

## MoSCoW

MoSCoW analysis helps developers understand which tasks to prioritise. It is a process by which labels are added to issues. These labels include 'Must-have', 'Could-have', 'Should-have' and ' Wont-have'.  In my project I had nearly an equal amount of 'Must-have' and 'Should-have' labels. On reflection I should have prioritised more 'Must-have' I also did not use 'Wont-have' and 'Could-have' in this project and this is something I would considering using more of in future projects as I found this technique useful to determine important work to be carried out.  The image below shows a portion of the issues associated with this project and their labels in place.
